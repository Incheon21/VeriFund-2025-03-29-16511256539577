# VeriFund

**VeriFund** is a decentralized, trustless platform built to revolutionize how people give. Powered by the Internet Computer, VeriFund allows anyone to create or contribute to donation campaigns with transparency, verifiability, and global accessibility.

Every donation is stored on-chain, publicly auditable, and protected by smart contract rules â€” ensuring that funds are not only received, but responsibly used. With a unique **proof-of-donation** and **proof-of-usage** model, VeriFund builds a culture of accountability without compromise.
